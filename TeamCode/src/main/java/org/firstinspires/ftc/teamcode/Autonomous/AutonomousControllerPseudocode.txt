Functions:
 @Autonomous
 + runOpMode():void
       pick up wobble goal
       rotate camera towards starter stack? (depends on camera location + orientation)

       scan starter stack
       if starter stack height is 0
           dropZone is STARTERSTACK A
       else if starter stack height is 1
           dropZone is STARTERSTACK B
       else if starter stack height is 4
           dropZone is STARTERSTACK C

       if dropZone is A
           move forward to nav image
       else
           move to the side
           move forward to nav image

       rotate camera towards nav image
       scan nav image

       if dropZone is A
           rotate so wobble goal is in/above zone(?)
           drop wobble goal
       else if dropZone is B
           move to zone B
           drop wobble goal
       else if dropZone is C
           move to zone C
           drop wobble goal
